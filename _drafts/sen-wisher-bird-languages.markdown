OAKLAND, CA 8/31/18 – Organ songwriter and composer Ben Swisher is releasing his second studio album, “Bird Languages,“ under the moniker Sen Wisher. From mysterious Eugene, Ben seeks answers from volcanoes, vacuums and now birds, through increasingly unruly soundscapes. Yawning organs, bowed banjos and pitch-processed vocals reach outward. Only more questions return.

Swisher recruited a nationwide all-star cast from his lonely perch in Oregon: Stuart Wheeler, Stephen Cope and Sophie Blair.

Bee Eater was produced by Stuart Wheeler (Quiet House) and Stephen Cope (officer jenny) and mastered by Nicholas Wilbur of <a href="http://www.anacortesunknown.com/studio">The Unknown</a>.
