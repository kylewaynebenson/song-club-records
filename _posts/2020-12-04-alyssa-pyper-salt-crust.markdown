SALT LAKE CITY, UT 12/4/20 - Some two years after the release of glowingly reviewed and fan-favored full-length album Bee Eater, folk singer-songwriter Emily Brown is releasing a brand-new LP. Her newest record, A Fish of Earth, is a brilliantly orchestrated folk mythology that tracks the highs and lows of living in relationship. It’s set to release on October 23rd, 2020.

Pre-order for A Fish of Earth is available on Bandcamp today, along with the first single from the album, “Game Show.” “Game Show” is available on all music platforms. It’s a tongue-in-cheek folk monologue on the complications of wanting and not wanting to have a kid in the modern world.

Emily and a host of collaborators recorded A Fish of Earth at <a href="http://studiostudiodada.com">Studio Studio Dada</a> in Provo, Utah. The album was arranged and produced by Brown’s longtime friends Bly Wallentine (Bat Manors, Jesse QT, Little Moon) and Stuart Wheeler (Quiet House). The album was mastered by Jack Shirley (Deafhaven, Jeff Rosenstock) of <a href="http://theatomicgarden.com/">The Atomic Garden</a> in Oakland, CA.

Pandemic concerns prevent Brown from scheduling a tour at this time, but she will be conducting a virtual tour via Instagram takeovers with various musicians and music venues. Follow her at @emilybrownmusic on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emilybrownmusic/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/emilybrownmusic/">Twitter</a> to keep up with virtual shows and lineups.

A Fish of Earth is comprised of 11 tracks, ranging from short, immediate ballads like Marianne (a succinct 57 seconds) to dreamy, oceanic meditations like “But You Might Rise” (a whopping 9 minutes). It’s a departure in some ways from Bee Eater’s jangle-pop influenced anthems. Instead, A Fish of Earth rambles and ruminates, showcasing Brown’s impressive vocal range and carefree yet virtuosic love of language.

Emily Brown currently lives in Oakland, California where she recently graduated from Mills College’s Creative Writing MFA, emphasizing in poetry. Her impressive vocal range, wandering melodies, and conversational lyrical style have drawn frequent comparisons to songwriters including Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Bridgers, and Fiona Apple. While in college, she was a founding member of folk bands Book on Tape Worm and Porch Lights. She was also a touring member of folk-pop group The National Parks. As a solo artist she has opened for or performed with Laura Veirs, Anna Tivel, and Mindy Gledhill.
