<h2 class="h2">Song Club Records needs someone to teach them how to use an iphone</h2>
<p class="subhead"> We're changing the way artists get paidâ€”and we don't want to stop short of changing the entire business model for musicians. We're a lean team that's just getting its footing, and we don't know what we're doing online.</p>

<h4 class="h4 orange">What's the opportunity? ðŸŒ…</h4>
As a team of one, you would be primarily responsible for curating and broadcasting the Song Club Records brand accross Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. We don't know how to run a company, so what you decide to do there and how you decide to do it will be your own business. Be creative! Don't be creative! We'll take either one!

<h4 class="h4 orange">What will you be doing? ðŸ”¨</h4>
* Help increase our following accross all social
* Writing captions, responding to comments
* Working with label artists to obtain images and posts ideas from them
* Small amount of customer support
* Save us from our woeful ignorance of social media

<h4 class="h4 orange">What skills do you need?</h4>
* Marketing experience would be amazing
* Ability to edit videos using iMovie


<h4 class="h4 orange">Benefits</h4>
* Opportunity to learn and explore in a low risk new company
* Meaningful contributions to an organization that is helping change music
* Hopefully payment one day (we <strong>totally</strong> mean this)
